One of the questions that we get asked the most when starting on JustTasks is how to delete tasks.
There are two ways to make them:

## Drag and delete

The first way I think is the best way. You can drag the task and drop on the trash icon in the lowe-right corner.

## Delete from context pop-up

You can also delete a task from the context menu that appears after clicking on the task.
