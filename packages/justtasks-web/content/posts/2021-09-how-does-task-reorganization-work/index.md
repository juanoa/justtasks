Task reorganization is a useful premium feature. If you don't complete a task today, 
it will be reorganized for tomorrow. It's as simple as that! But, how does it work? 
How can I upgrade to the premium tier? These questions will be answered in this article.

## How does task reorganization work?

When you enter to JustTasks, you request all your tasks, complete and incomplete ones. 
The JustTask server checks if you have any incomplete past tasks. For example, you didn't 
call your mother yesterday. No problem! You can still be a good son. **The JustTask server 
changes the date of your past task to today**.

Now you can think: well, but how does the server know what time it is in my house? When 
you send a request, you also send in the header your current DateTime. This means that 
**if you are travelling to China or Australia, you can also use the task reorganization feature**.

## How to get this feature?

You can enjoy this feature **by upgrading to the premium tier**. How to upgrade to the premium tier? Easy:

1. Create a JustTask account
2. Login in to your account
3. Go to Configuration and then to the Premium section
4. Start a new checkout and add your payment information
5. Enjoy all the features of JustTasks Premium!

And that's all, I hope you enjoy Task Reorganization!
